# Welcome to VJlxnr

This site is launched in order to give some background information and 
knowledge about my (one more) simple VJing tool VJlxnr.

Here you can find detailed documentation, loose collections of technical 
specifications and other notes which fell into existence while developing 
the project.

The blog part of this site will be updated in irregular intervals and will 
keep you informed about news, new releases and other resources.

If you have tried out the max4live device VJlxnr feel free to send a link to 
your work or your review …

So I wish you lots of fun fiddling around with the device …
