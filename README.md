# VJlxnr

… (one more) simple VJing tool made with Max/Jitter/Max4Live …

## What it does …

It moves and zooms an image according to the audio level which is grabbed at periodic intervals or by a given threshold. Optional a second image layer can be switched on, which moves independently from the other image. The resulting image is calculated by multiplicating the pixel values.

## What it contains …

The project contains a standalone Max/Jitter Version (in the _patchers_ folder the file called _vjlxnr.maxpat_) and a Max4Live Audio FX Device to plug into a track of Ableton Live (look for the file _m4l.vjlxnr.amxd_ in the _patchers_ folder).

## How it works …

* Select a resolution for the target window containing the video FX.
* Drop a folder containing (up to 32) images (currently only PNGs are supported) on the dropfile zone.
* Stream in sound.
* Play with the knobs.
* Enjoy that psychedelic shit …
