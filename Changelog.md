# Changelog

_(Versions tagged 'vX.Y.Z+freeze' are not mentioned here, they relate to the respective versions but are the 'frozen' versions of the device, as recommended for distribution)_

## Caveats / known issues

* Before changing the image resolution or loading a new set of images it is recommended to stop the Live transport, since these actions need a lot of ressources so performance could lag.
* Currently only PNG images are supported.
* When using Ableton Push switching between note- and session-mode causes a short lag of video movement.
* Some PNG files happen to show not correctly in preview window and won't render in [jit.window] - this seems possibly to happen due to color profile issues - maybe ...
